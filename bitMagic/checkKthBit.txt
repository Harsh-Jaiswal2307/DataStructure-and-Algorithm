Problem:
    Check Kth bit is set or not.

Given a number n, check if kth bit on n is set or not.

What is set???
    A Kth bit is said to be set if, that bit is 1.
    
    ex. if n = 5 ==> (101) and its 1st bit is set...
    
    
IP: n = 5 k = 1
OP: SET

IP: n = 2 k = 3
OP: NOT SET  coz all bit beyond MAB are not set.

Method 1: Using left shift operator
Method 2: Using the right shift operator
